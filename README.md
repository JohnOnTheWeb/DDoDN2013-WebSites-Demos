Dallas Day of .NET 2013 Web Sites Demos
=======================

These samples are the demos done in the Windows Azure Web Sites talks put on by Brady Gaster at the Dallas Day of .NET conference. 

# Thanks, Smarx! #
Steve Marx wrote a blog post that inspired one of the demonstrations in this sample code. You can read about his Web Capture service on his blog [here](http://blog.smarx.com/posts/web-page-image-capture-in-windows-azure). I basically copied, pasted, and updated the source code to use the new Windows Storage APIs, which are available in the [WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/).
